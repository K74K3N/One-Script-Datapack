# One-Script-Datapack

I made this a while ago for minecraft java edition 1.19.3. 

If you want to change the name of the datapack you need to go into the actual file, and change the name manually.

On Linux open the folder that contains the script, and open in terminal. (Or go there yourself via cd)

Then run: python InstantDatapack.py

I don't use windows, but I think it is the same command. Good luck.
